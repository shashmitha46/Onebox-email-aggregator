# Reachinbox


A unified email aggregation system that connects multiple IMAP accounts, syncs emails in real-time using IMAP IDLE, and provides fast search powered by Elasticsearch. Includes a FastAPI backend and a modern React + Vite frontend.

## Tech Stack

- **PNPM**: Prefer pnpm
- **Frontend**: React 18 + React Router 6 (spa) + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS 3
- **Backend**: Express server integrated with Vite dev server
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **UI**: Radix UI + TailwindCSS 3 + Lucide React icons

## Project Structure

```

├── App.tsx                # App entry point and with SPA routing setup
└── global.css            # TailwindCSS 3 theming and global styles

└── api.ts                # Example of how to share api interfaces
```

## Key Features

## SPA Routing System

The routing system is powered by React Router 6:

- `client/pages/Index.tsx` represents the home page.
- Routes are defined in `client/App.tsx` using the `react-router-dom` import
- Route files are located in the `client/pages/` directory

For example, routes can be defined with:

```typescript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Index />} />
  {/* ADD ALL CUSTOM ROUTES ABOVE THE CATCH-ALL "*" ROUTE */}
  <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
</Routes>;
```

### Styling System

- **Primary**: TailwindCSS 3 utility classes
- **Theme and design tokens**: Configure in `client/global.css` 
- **UI components**: Pre-built library in `client/components/ui/`
- **Utility**: `cn()` function combines `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` for conditional classes

```typescript
// cn utility usage
className={cn(
  "base-classes",
  { "conditional-class": condition },
  props.className  // User overrides
)}
```

### Express Server Integration

- **Development**: Single port (8080) for both frontend/backend
- **Hot reload**: Both client and server code
- **API endpoints**: Prefixed with `/api/`

#### Example API Routes
- `GET /api/ping` - Simple ping api
- `GET /api/demo` - Demo endpoint  

### Multi-Account IMAP Support

- Connect and sync multiple email accounts.
- Persistent IMAP connections.
- Real-time updates using IDLE (no cron jobs).

### Real-Time Email Synchronization
- Fetches last 30 days of emails.
- Detects new incoming messages instantly.
- Background IMAP listeners per account.

### Searchable Storage (Elasticsearch)
- Each email is indexed in Elasticsearch.
- Fast full-text search on subject, body, and metadata.

### REST API (FastAPI)
- Email listing APIs
- Search APIs
- Account registration APIs
- Status, healthcheck & debug endpoints

## Development Commands

```bash
pnpm dev        # Start dev server (client + server)
pnpm build      # Production build
pnpm start      # Start production server
pnpm typecheck  # TypeScript validation
pnpm test          # Run Vitest tests
```

## Environment Variables

Create a file:
backend/.env
```
IMAP_HOST=imap.gmail.com
IMAP_USER=your_email@example.com
IMAP_PASSWORD=yourpassword

MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
MONGO_DB=emaildb

ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://localhost:9200
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_if_used
```

## Architecture Notes

- Single-port development with Vite + Express integration
- TypeScript throughout (client, server, shared)
- Full hot reload for rapid development
- Production-ready with multiple deployment options
- Comprehensive UI component library included
- Type-safe API communication via shared interfaces
